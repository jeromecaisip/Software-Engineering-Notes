# Chapter 1 - Clean Code

1. Clean code looks like it was written by someone who cares.

2. As programmers, we are authors. It's an author's responsibility to for communicating well with their readers.

3. Be professional. Defend the codebase with passion, it's unprofessional for a programmer to bent to the will of the managers
who don't understand the risks of making messes.

4. Bad code is more expensive in the long run. In terms of providing value to the business, bad code decreases productivity over time because bad code leads to more bad codes,
and eventually will lead to abandonment of the codebase which is more expensive.

5. In software, 80% or more of the work is maintenance, so if you want to succeed you have to make the code
maintainable and clean. 

6. Good software requires discipline, presence of mind and thinking.

7. Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) pillars/5s:
    - Sort  - Throw away unused things. Remove legacy code, unused methods and variables, commented and duplicated code, etc.
    - Systematize - A piece of code should be where you expect to find it, if not re-factor to get it there.
    - Shine - Clean often (eg.remove old comments, unneeded code, refactor, write and run tests). Apply "Boy scout rule".
    - Standardize - Set a coding standard, quality checks, process, etc.
    - Sustain/Self-discipline - Adhere to the standards and always do the right thing.


8. Boy scout rule. (Leave the ground cleaner when you found it)


# Chapter 2 - Meaningful Names

1. Use intention revealing names.

2. Avoid disinformation. 

3. Make meaningful distinction. If names are different, then they should also mean something different.

4. Use pronounceable names.

5. Use searchable names.

7. Avoid encodings.

8. Avoid hungarian notation.

9. Avoid mental mapping.

10. Class names should have noun or noun phrase names.

11. Methods/functions should have verb or verb phrase names.

12. Pick one word per concept (avoid using synonymous words). (eg. fetch, get, retrieve) and (manager, controller, driver)

13. Don't pun. Don't use same word two two purposes.

14. Use solution domain names for code for code that has more to do with the CS/technical/programming  concepts.

15. Use problem/business domain names for code that has more to do with the problem/business domain concepts.

16. Add meaningful context when a name is not meaningful enough by themselves. (eg. prefixing)

17. Don't add unnecessary context.
